## Description


This app is based on a course founded on YT [link](https://youtu.be/tdxKIPpPDAI). </br>
Basically, I have followed along to learn the basics of using the API. </br>
Besides that, I have added a couple of extra features to the app. </br>
You just have to use the text field to type ISO Alpha 2 code and check for holidays in your country of choice. </br>
After that list of holidays is shown in Table View and the also title says how many countries have been funded in this country. </br>
As basic starting value country code is set to `PL` so it is showing holidays for POLAND ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±. </br>



## Techonogies

It is a native application that has been made using Swift with Storyboard.



## UI description
UI is just one screen with `TableView`. </br>
On first loading, it is set to download data for Poland and show each holiday as a cell in Table View. </br>
I am using NavigationControler and as the number of holidays + country flag emoji is shown as the title. </br>

## TableView
Scrolling thru all cells in TableView: </br>

## Room for improvements

- First of all, I am using not the best image as LaunchScreen. This could be upgraded just by using better resolution for the image. /Br>
Unfortunately, I haven't had a better one ðŸ˜¢. </br>
